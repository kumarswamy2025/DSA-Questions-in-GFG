# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository

Welcome to my professional DSA practice repository. This repository documents the collection of coding problems I have solved as part of my preparation for technical interviews and to enhance my algorithmic thinking and coding proficiency.

## 📌 Objective

This repository serves as a structured record of my problem-solving journey, categorized both **topic-wise** and **pattern-wise** (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming). It showcases not only the breadth of problems I have tackled but also the structured approach I followed in mastering core DSA concepts.

## ✅ Key Highlights

- 📂 Organized by **Data Structure** (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- 📌 Categorized by **Problem Solving Patterns** (e.g., Sliding Window, BFS/DFS, Greedy, Two Pointers, Recursion/Backtracking)
- 💡 Each solution includes:
  - Problem statement or reference link
  - Code implementation in Java/Python/C++
  - Comments explaining the approach
  - Time and space complexity analysis

## 📚 Patterns Covered

- ✅ Sliding Window
- ✅ Two Pointers
- ✅ Fast and Slow Pointers
- ✅ Binary Search
- ✅ BFS & DFS
- ✅ Backtracking
- ✅ Greedy Algorithms
- ✅ Dynamic Programming
- ✅ Kadane's Algorithm
- ✅ Prefix Sum, Hashing, and more...

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Heaps & HashMaps
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Bit Manipulation
- Dynamic Programming
